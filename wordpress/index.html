      <h1>WordPress development prices</h1>

      <p>
        WordPress is a Content Management System which allows the owner of the
        website to add, delete, and change content. Content means pages or posts
        with their text and images, but not how this content is displayed or how
        the website works. That is the job of the theme. The theme is what
        decides how the content is displayed and laid out, and how the site
        behaves in general. When making a website with WordPress, basically what
        is being made is the theme.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are free and premium paid themes to be found all over the
        internet. You can search on google for "wordpress themes", or you can
        search the official WordPress theme directory:
        <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/"
          >https://wordpress.org/themes/</a
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        With that in consideration, I have 3 basic packages to make websites
        powered by WordPress. Additionally, there's the option to turn each of
        these 3 packages into an eCommerce web shop.
      </p>

      <h2>Low Budget - $250 USD</h2>
      <p>
        Find an already made theme and use it as is. What I will be doing is
        installing WordPress and setting up the theme and plugins needed for the
        site to work. I will create the pages (up to about 10 pages) and add the
        content, including the logo, background images, and such. The website
        will end up looking exactly as the chosen theme, with your content in
        it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This option is ideal if you have a low budget, just want a simple
        website or blog, and don't mind that there will be other websites on the
        internet looking like yours. Good for getting some basic information
        online of a small business just starting out.
      </p>
      <p>I will take about a week for this option.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Customized - $500 USD</h2>
      <p>
        Find an already made theme and customize it. In this case I will create
        what is called a "child theme". That means that the theme used is based
        on a parent theme which would be the theme found or bought online. The
        main functionality of the website would be as that of the chosen theme,
        but I could do a limited amount of customization to how the pages are
        displayed and laid out as far as the theme allows. Additionally, I will
        do cosmetic changes, such as change colors, fonts, icons, and other
        decorations. The finished website can look very different than the
        original theme, but behind the scenes it still works like the parent
        theme and is limited to what the parent theme allows.
      </p>
      <p>
        This options is ideal if you want your website to have a unique look,
        but don't have any special requirements for how the website should work.
        Good for a small business with the budget to get some basic information
        online on a website that looks unique.
      </p>
      <p>I will take about two weeks for this option.</p>

      <hr />

      <h2>Professional â€“ starting at $750 USD</h2>
      <p>
        This is the one to choose if you really are serious about your website.
        I will make the theme myself from scratch. We'll have complete
        flexibility and freedom to do things as you want. The website can be
        made to your specifications with no limitations from any parent theme.
        Everything from colors and fonts to positioning of elements and
        functionality of the website. The admin area to add and edit content
        will be customized and easier to work with. It will be easier to
        maintain and upgrade the website in the future when you want to add new
        features and functionality to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This option is ideal if you want a truly professional website, custom
        made to your specific needs and wishes. Good for an established business
        who wants to take its online presence to the next level, or a new
        business wanting to start with the best possible website from the
        beginning.
      </p>
      <p>I will take three or more weeks for this option.</p>

    <section>
      <h2>eCommerce extra - $250 USD</h2>
      <p>
        Upgrade any of the options above to an online shop for an additional
        cost of $250 USD. I will use the WooCommerce plugin to add and set up a
        web shop where you can sell products from your website.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        <b>NOTE:</b> You will have to get and pay for the hosting and domain
        separately at a company of your choice. I will help you with choosing
        and setting up, but I don't host websites or sell domains myself.
