        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>I'm Sebastian Lacl&eacute;, a web designer / front end developer from Aruba currently spending some time in

        <ul>
            <li>This was a test project for a job application.</li>
            <li>The link above is to a CSS only version, but you can see the source of the Vue.js version at <a href="https://github.com/slacle/questions"
                    target="_blank">its repository</a>.</li>
            <li>The CSS version contains 3 views: <a href="https://slacle.com/projects/questions/">index</a>, <a href="https://slacle.com/projects/questions/single.html">single</a>,
                and <a href="https://slacle.com/projects/questions/profile.html">profile</a>.</li>
            <li>I was given a series of jpeg images for how the app needed to look on different screen sizes, and I had
                to turn it into code.</li>
            <li>I was given some tasks to complete, but in general I was free to use any technology I wanted. I chose
                to use Vue.js. And there was no description as to what the app itself was supposed to do.</li>
            <li>I completed the required tasks, but there is obviously a lot more that could have been done if I
                wanted, but I didn't have more time.</li>
            <li>Some of the working functionality in the Vue.js version include:
                <br><br>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 different views. All questions, single question (page for each question), and profile view
                        (page for each user).</li>
                    <li>Searching works.</li>
                    <li>The radio inputs change the questions to a single one from one user that I picked when on "My
                        shelf".</li>
                    <li>The voting of the question itself allows to vote once up and once down.</li>
                    <li>The questions and comments, the users, and some (not all) of the data are loaded dynamically
                        from a JSON file that I created myself.</li>
                </ul>

                the test by <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByttPtpep419WTl6UVkzY09zSnM">clicking here to
                    download the zip file from my Google Drive</a>.</li>
            <li>In the zip file you will find the readme file which describes what I had to do. In short, the src
                folder had some things to start with and I had to build on it. Basically the folder structure is what
                was there and some minimum HTML to get started. I had to do the rest of the HTML using Handlebars.js
                and all the CSS using Less. The build folder is the compiled output to be used for production.</li>

            <li>The link above is to a static version, but you can see a dynamic version by <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByttPtpep419YTkyM3hKVFRvakk">clicking
                    here to download the zip file from my Google Drive</a>.</li>
            <li>I had to do a tabs component that turns into accordion on smaller screens.</li>
            <li>The dynamic version uses AJAX to load the content on click, so it needs to run on a server environment
                to work.</li>
            <li>I had to not use absolute positioning for the content, no JS for the tabs/accordion functionality, and
                it had to support IE9.</li>
            <li>I purposely kept it as simple and with as little markup as possible.</li>

            <li><a href="http://wrapbootstrap.com/preview/WB0R5L90S" target="_blank">Inspinia theme</a> was used as a
                starting template.</li>
            <li>I had to use modern techniques such as Responsive Web Design and required a lot of attention to detail
                to complete the tasks.</li>
            <li>Here's an <a href="projects/dashboard/">empty page</a> to use as a template to create the rest of the

            <li>I used WordPress to create a modern, yet profesional looking website that is responsive and optimized
